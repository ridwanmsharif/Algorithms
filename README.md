# Algorithms

This repository is dedicated largely to Algorithms that I've found quite interesting or intimidating enough for me to give a shot.
I intend to contribute to this repo regularly with solutions to problem sets as I see fit. 
Hopefully soon enough you'll find this repo populated with all sorts of interesting algorithms.
Feedback on implementations are of course welcome.

## Algorithms:

Algorithms I've implemented and pushed to this repo so far:
+ Convex Hull Generator
+ Levenshtien's Edit Distance
+ Unique Substring Problem
+ Bounded Substring Problem
+ Dice-Coefficient/Sorenson-Index (2-Pair)
